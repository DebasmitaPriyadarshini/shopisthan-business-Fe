            unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner as it
            protects its own Confidential Information of similar nature or
            importance, and in any event, using no less than reasonable care.
            Except as otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to this Agreement,
            the receiving party may use the disclosing party’s Confidential
            Information solely to exercise its respective rights and perform its
            respective obligations under this Agreement, and will disclose such
            Confidential Information solely to those of its respective
            employees, representatives and agents who have a need to know such
            Confidential Information for such purposes and who are bound by
            obligations to maintain the confidentiality of, and not misuse, such
            Confidential Information. The provisions of this section will
            supersede any non-disclosure agreement by and between the parties
            entered into prior to this Agreement that would purport to address
            the confidentiality of any information shared by the parties,
            including Customer Data, and such agreement will have no further
            force or effect with respect to the foregoing. If the receiving
            party is required by law or court order to disclose Confidential
            Information of the disclosing party, then the receiving party will,
            to the extent legally permitted, provide the disclosing party with
            advance written notification and cooperate in any effort to obtain
            confidential treatment of the Confidential Information. The
            receiving party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential
            Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone
            would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such
            disclosure by the receiving party, the disclosing party will be
            entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to
            whatever other remedies it might have at law.
